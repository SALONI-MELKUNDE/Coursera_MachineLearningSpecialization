# Machine Learning Specialization Labs

This repository contains labs and supporting materials for three courses:

- **C1 – Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification**
- **C2 – Advanced Learning Algorithms**
- **C3 – Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning**

Each course is organized into weekly folders, with Jupyter notebooks, data files, and helper scripts inside.
